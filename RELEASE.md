# To release a new version of the package

Add new `@mdi/js` version to `package.json`, for example:
- the PR should have the title - feat: update to v7.4.47
- to release v7.4.47, update `@mdi/js` to 7.4.47
- update package.json version to 7.4.46 and release a patch version (bumpp cannot release same version)
